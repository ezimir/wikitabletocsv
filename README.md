Convert tables on wikipedia pages to CSV file

## Other solutions

I find these solutions not to be satisfactory to my needs:

 * http://wikitable2csv.ggor.de works fine, but doesn't merge tables, and can't be used in CLI
 * https://bitbucket.org/JanKanis/wiki2csv requires to download the page, doesn't extract text from links

Therefore, I'm doing my own!
